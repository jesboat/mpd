 *
 * A set of library functions to make lock-free ringbuffers available
 * to JACK clients.  The `capture_client.c' (in the example_clients
 * directory) is a fully functioning user of this API.
 *
 * The key attribute of a ringbuffer is that it can be safely accessed
 * by two threads simultaneously -- one reading from the buffer and
 * the other writing to it -- without using any synchronization or
 * mutual exclusion primitives.  For this to work correctly, there can
 * only be a single reader and a single writer thread.  Their
 * identities cannot be interchanged.
